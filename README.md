The Shoe Purchase App is a simple Python application that helps you manage your shoe budget. It allows you to input your shoe budget and suggests which shoes you can buy within that budget. The app uses the `Shoes` class from the `Shoes.py` script to handle the shoe details and budget calculations.

## Features

- Define different types of shoes with their names and prices.
- Input your shoe budget and see which shoes you can afford.
- Get information about the shoes you can buy and any remaining budget.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local environment.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
5. Run the application using the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```

6. Enter your shoe budget when prompted.
7. The application will suggest the shoes you can buy within your budget and provide additional information, such as the remaining budget if applicable.

## Example

```
$ python3 main.py
What is your shoe budget? 200

You can buy these shoes and have $ 170.0 left over
